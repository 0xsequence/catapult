# Catapult

**Catapult** is a powerful Ethereum contract deployment and management framework designed to simplify the orchestration of complex contract deployments across multiple blockchain networks. Built with TypeScript and Node.js, it provides a declarative YAML-based approach to defining deployment jobs, templates, and dependencies.

## Overview

Catapult addresses the challenge of managing complex contract deployment scenarios where multiple contracts need to be deployed in a specific order, with dependencies between them, across multiple blockchain networks. Instead of writing custom deployment scripts for each scenario, you define your deployment logic declaratively using YAML files.

### Key Features

- **üîÑ Declarative Deployment Jobs**: Define complex deployment workflows using YAML configuration files
- **üìã Template System**: Create reusable deployment templates that can be shared across projects
- **üîó Dependency Management**: Automatic resolution of deployment dependencies and execution ordering
- **üåê Multi-Network Support**: Deploy to multiple blockchain networks simultaneously
- **‚ö° Built-in Actions**: Comprehensive set of built-in actions for common deployment tasks
- **üßÆ Value Resolvers**: Powerful system for computing values, encoding data, and performing calculations
- **‚úÖ Skip Conditions**: Smart conditional logic to avoid redundant deployments
- **üîç Validation & Dry Run**: Validate configurations and preview deployment plans without execution
- **üìä Event System**: Rich event system for monitoring deployment progress and debugging
- **üßæ Multi-platform Verification**: Verify on Etherscan v2 and Sourcify (tries all configured platforms by default)

## Project Structure

A Catapult project follows this structure:

```
my-deployment-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ networks.yaml              # Network configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jobs/                      # Deployment job definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core-contracts.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ factory-setup.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ token-deployment.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/                 # Custom template definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ erc20-factory.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ proxy-deployment.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artifacts/                 # Contract build artifacts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyContract.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Factory.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output/                    # Generated deployment results
```

## Configuration

### Networks Configuration

Create a `networks.yaml` file in your project root to define target networks:

```yaml
- name: "Ethereum Mainnet"
  chainId: 1
  rpcUrl: "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID"

- name: "Arbitrum One"
  chainId: 42161
  rpcUrl: "https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc"

- name: "Polygon"
  chainId: 137
  rpcUrl: "https://polygon-rpc.com"
  supports: ["etherscan_v2"]  # Optional: verification platforms supported
  gasLimit: 500000            # Optional: gas limit for all transactions on this network
  testnet: true               # Optional: mark as test network
  evmVersion: "cancun"        # Optional: network EVM hardfork (e.g., london, paris, shanghai, cancun)
```

The `supports` field is optional and specifies which verification platforms are available for the network. Currently supported platforms:

- `etherscan_v2`: Etherscan v2 verification API (supports Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, BSC, etc.)
- `sourcify`: Sourcify verification (no API key required)

If `supports` is omitted, all built-in platforms are allowed for that network. Etherscan requires an API key to be considered ‚Äúconfigured‚Äù; Sourcify requires no configuration. The `gasLimit` field is optional and specifies a fixed gas limit to use for all transactions on this network. If not specified, the system will use ethers.js default gas estimation.

### Constants

You can define reusable values in constants files or directly within a job.

- Top-level constants are discovered anywhere under your project root by adding YAML files with `type: "constants"`.
- Keys must be unique across all constants files; duplicates will fail the load.
- Within jobs/templates, reference constants using bare placeholders like `{{MY_CONSTANT}}`.
- Job-level constants override top-level constants when names collide.

Example top-level constants file (can be placed anywhere, e.g., `constants.yaml`):

```yaml
type: "constants"

constants:
  address-zero: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  salt-zero: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  developer-multisig-01: "0x007a47e6BF40C1e0ed5c01aE42fDC75879140bc4"
  entrypoint-4337-07: "0x0000000071727de22e5e9d8baf0edac6f37da032"
```

Job-level constants example (defined at the top of a job):

```yaml
name: "job-with-constants"
version: "1"
constants:
  FEE: "1000"
  ADMIN: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
actions:
  - name: "example"
    template: "some-template"
    arguments:
      admin: "{{ADMIN}}"      # resolves to job-level constant
      defaultSalt: "{{salt-zero}}"  # resolves to top-level constant
```

Tip: Use `catapult list constants` to see discovered top-level constants and any job-level constants.

#### RPC URL tokens via environment variables

You can inject secrets (like access tokens) into `rpcUrl` using placeholders of the form `{{RPC_...}}`. At load time, any placeholder whose name starts with `RPC` will be replaced with the value of the corresponding environment variable. Placeholders not starting with `RPC` are left as-is.

Example `networks.yaml`:

```yaml
- name: "MyNet"
  chainId: 999
  rpcUrl: "https://node.url/something/{{RPC_URL_TOKEN}}"
```

With an environment variable:

```bash
export RPC_URL_TOKEN="my-secret-token"
```

Resulting `rpcUrl` at runtime:

```
https://node.url/something/my-secret-token
```

Notes:
- If an `{{RPC_*}}` placeholder is present and the corresponding environment variable is not set, loading will fail with a clear error.
- Multiple RPC tokens in one URL are supported, and whitespace inside the token delimiters is ignored (e.g., `{{  RPC_TOKEN  }}`).

### Job Definitions

Jobs are the core deployment units. Create YAML files in the `jobs/` directory:

```yaml
# jobs/core-contracts.yaml
name: "core-contracts"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Deploy core system contracts"

actions:
  - name: "deploy-factory"
    template: "sequence-universal-deployer-2"
    arguments:
      creationCode: "{{Contract(MyFactory).creationCode}}"
      salt: "0"

  - name: "deploy-implementation"
    template: "sequence-universal-deployer-2"
    depends_on: ["deploy-factory"]
    arguments:
      creationCode:
        type: "constructor-encode"
        arguments:
          creationCode: "{{Contract(MyImplementation).creationCode}}"
          types: ["address"]
          values: ["{{deploy-factory.address}}"]
      salt: "0"
```

#### Per-job network filters

Jobs run on all selected networks by default. You can restrict or exclude networks for a specific job by chain ID:

```yaml
name: "token-deployment"
version: "1.0.0"

# Run only on these networks (takes precedence if present)
only_networks: [1, 42161]

# Or, skip these networks (used only if only_networks is not set)
# skip_networks: [137]

actions:
  - name: "deploy"
    template: "erc-2470"
    arguments: { /* ... */ }
```

Rules:
- If `only_networks` is set and non-empty, the job runs only on those chain IDs.
- Else, if `skip_networks` is set and non-empty, the job is skipped on those chain IDs.
- Otherwise, the job runs on all networks selected for the run (via `networks.yaml` or `--network`).

#### Minimum EVM version per job

Jobs can declare a minimum EVM hardfork they require. When a network‚Äôs `evmVersion` is older than the job‚Äôs `min_evm_version`, the job is skipped on that network.

```yaml
name: "post-shanghai-feature"
version: "1.0.0"
min_evm_version: "shanghai"

actions:
  - name: "deploy"
    template: "erc-2470"
    arguments: { /* ... */ }
```

Supported identifiers include: `frontier`, `homestead`, `tangerine`, `spuriousdragon`, `byzantium`, `constantinople`, `petersburg`, `istanbul`, `berlin`, `london`, `paris` (The Merge), `shanghai`, `cancun`, `prague`.

#### Deprecating jobs

Mark a job as deprecated to opt it out of normal runs without deleting it:

```yaml
name: "legacy-seed"
version: "1.2.3"
deprecated: true
actions:
  - name: "noop"
    type: "static"
    arguments: { value: null }
```

Behavior:
- Deprecated jobs are skipped by default when running without specifying job names.
- Explicitly targeting a deprecated job on the CLI will run it even without extra flags: `catapult run legacy-seed -k $PRIVATE_KEY`.
- To include all deprecated jobs in a normal run, pass `--run-deprecated`: `catapult run --run-deprecated -k $PRIVATE_KEY`.
- If a non-deprecated job depends on a deprecated job, that deprecated dependency is ALWAYS included automatically to satisfy dependencies (even without `--run-deprecated`).

### Template Definitions

Templates are reusable deployment patterns. Create them in the `templates/` directory:

```yaml
# templates/proxy-factory.yaml
name: "proxy-factory"
type: "template"

arguments:
  implementation:
    type: "address"
  salt:
    type: "bytes32"

returns:
  address:
    type: "address"

setup:
  - type: "job-completed"
    arguments:
      job: "core-contracts"

actions:
  - type: "send-transaction"
    arguments:
      to: "{{core-contracts.deploy-factory.address}}"
      data:
        type: "abi-encode"
        arguments:
          signature: "createProxy(address,bytes32)"
          values:
            - "{{implementation}}"
            - "{{salt}}"

skip_condition:
  - type: "contract-exists"
    arguments:
      address:
        type: "compute-create2"
        arguments:
          deployerAddress: "{{core-contracts.deploy-factory.address}}"
          salt: "{{salt}}"
          initCode:
            type: "constructor-encode"
            arguments:
              creationCode: "{{Contract(ProxyBytecode).creationCode}}"
              types: ["address"]
              values: ["{{implementation}}"]

outputs:
  address:
    type: "compute-create2"
    arguments:
      deployerAddress: "{{core-contracts.deploy-factory.address}}"
      salt: "{{salt}}"
      initCode:
        type: "constructor-encode"
        arguments:
          creationCode: "{{Contract(ProxyBytecode).creationCode}}"
          types: ["address"]
          values: ["{{implementation}}"]
```

Notes about template files:
- The `type: "template"` discriminator is optional but recommended for clarity. If provided, it must be exactly `template`.
- Templates are auto-discovered from your project `templates/` folder and any `templates/` subfolders under `jobs/`.

## Usage

### Running Deployments

Deploy all jobs to all configured networks:

```bash
catapult run --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Deploy specific jobs:

```bash
catapult run core-contracts token-setup --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Deploy multiple jobs using wildcards (matches job names, including nested names like `sequence_v3/beta_4`):

```bash
# Run all jobs whose name starts with "sequence_"
catapult run sequence_* -k $PRIVATE_KEY

# Run all jobs under a namespace/folder-like prefix
catapult run "sequence_v3/*" -k $PRIVATE_KEY

# Combine patterns and exact names; duplicates are de-duplicated
catapult run job1 job? -k $PRIVATE_KEY
```

Deploy to specific networks:

```bash
catapult run --network 1 42161 --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Common options (run):

- `-p, --project <path>`: Project root directory (defaults to current directory)
- `--dotenv <path>`: Load environment variables from a custom .env file (run command only)
- `-n, --network <chainIds...>`: One or more chain IDs to target
- `--rpc-url <url>`: Run against a single custom RPC; chain ID is auto-detected (no networks.yaml required)
- `-k, --private-key <key>`: EOA private key (or set `PRIVATE_KEY`)
- `--etherscan-api-key <key>`: Etherscan API key (or set `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`)
- `--fail-early`: Stop as soon as any job fails
- `--no-post-check-conditions`: Skip post-execution evaluation of skip conditions
- `--flat-output`: Write outputs in a single flat `output/` directory (do not mirror `jobs/` structure)
- `--no-summary`: Hide the end-of-run summary
- `--run-deprecated`: Allow running jobs marked `deprecated: true` (otherwise skipped unless explicitly targeted)
- `--no-std`: Do not load built-in standard templates
- `-v, --verbose` (repeatable): Increase logging verbosity (`-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`)

Examples:

- Using a custom RPC (no networks.yaml needed):

```bash
catapult run --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 -k $PRIVATE_KEY
```

- Write outputs flat instead of mirroring `jobs/` folders:

```bash
catapult run --flat-output -k $PRIVATE_KEY
```

- Run a deprecated job explicitly:
  - Without flag (explicit targeting runs it):
    ```bash
    catapult run legacy-job -k $PRIVATE_KEY
    ```
  - Or include all deprecated jobs in the plan:
    ```bash
    catapult run --run-deprecated -k $PRIVATE_KEY
    ```

### Validation and Dry Run

Validate your configuration without executing transactions:

```bash

# Fetch source (standard-json or flattened) from Etherscan v2
catapult etherscan source -n 1 -a 0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7 --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

## Built-in Actions

Catapult provides several built-in primitive actions:

### `send-transaction`
Send a transaction to the blockchain:

```yaml
- type: "send-transaction"
  arguments:
    to: "0x742..."
    value: "1000000000000000000"  # 1 ETH in wei
    data: "0x..."
    gasMultiplier: 1.5  # Optional: multiply gas limit by this factor
```

The `gasMultiplier` parameter is optional and allows you to tune the gas limit before sending the transaction:
- If a network gas limit is configured, it will be multiplied by this factor
- If no network gas limit is set, gas will be estimated first, then multiplied by this factor
- Must be a positive number (e.g., 1.5 for 50% more gas, 0.8 for 20% less gas)

### `send-signed-transaction`
Broadcast a pre-signed transaction:

```yaml
- type: "send-signed-transaction"
  arguments:
    transaction: "0x..."  # Raw signed transaction
```

### `static`
Sets a static value that can be referenced in subsequent steps. Useful for defining constants or passing data between actions.

```yaml
- type: "static"
  name: "my-value"
  arguments:
    value: "hello world"
```

The `name` field is optional. When provided, the value is stored under [`name.value`](src/lib/core/engine.ts:560) in the context. If omitted, the value is computed but not stored. Supports all JSON data types including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and arrays.

Example with complex data:

```yaml
- type: "static"
  name: "config"
  arguments:
    value:
      endpoint: "https://api.example.com"
      timeout: 5000
      enabled: true
```

This makes `config.value.endpoint`, `config.value.timeout`, and `config.value.enabled` available for use in subsequent actions.

### `create-contract`
Create a contract by sending its creation bytecode (and optional value):

```yaml
- type: "create-contract"
  name: "deploy-foo"
  arguments:
    data: "{{Contract(Foo).creationCode}}"
    gasMultiplier: 1.2
```

### `json-request`
Make an HTTP JSON request and use the result downstream:

```yaml
- type: "json-request"
  name: "get-config"
  arguments:
    url: "https://example.com/config.json"
    method: "GET"
```

## Value Resolvers

Catapult includes powerful value resolvers for computing complex values:

### `abi-encode`
ABI-encode function call data:

```yaml
data:
  type: "abi-encode"
  arguments:
    signature: "transfer(address,uint256)"
    values:
      - "0x742..."
      - "1000000000000000000"
```

### `constructor-encode`
Encode constructor parameters with bytecode:

```yaml
creationCode:
  type: "constructor-encode"
  arguments:
    creationCode: "{{Contract(MyContract).creationCode}}"
    types: ["address", "uint256"]
    values: ["{{factory.address}}", "100"]
```

### `abi-pack`
Pack values per ABI types into bytes:

```yaml
payload:
  type: "abi-pack"
  arguments:
    types: ["address", "uint256"]
    values: ["{{recipient}}", "{{amount}}"]
```

### `compute-create2`
Compute CREATE2 addresses:

```yaml
address:
  type: "compute-create2"
  arguments:
    deployerAddress: "{{factory.address}}"
    salt: "{{salt}}"
    initCode: "{{creationCode}}"
```

### `basic-arithmetic`
Perform mathematical operations:

```yaml
amount:
  type: "basic-arithmetic"
  arguments:
    operation: "add"
    values: ["{{current_balance}}", "1000000000000000000"]
```

### `read-balance`
Read account balance:

```yaml
balance:
  type: "read-balance"
  arguments:
    address: "{{deployer_address}}"
```

### `call`
Make view/pure function calls:

```yaml
result:
  type: "call"
  arguments:
    to: "{{contract.address}}"
    signature: "getName()"
    values: []
```

### `verify-contract`
### `read-json`
Read a value from a JSON object at a given path:

```yaml
tokenAddress:
  type: "read-json"
  arguments:
    json: "{{get-config.response}}"
    path: "tokens.usdc.address"
```
Verify deployed contracts on block explorers:

```yaml
- type: "verify-contract"
  arguments:
    address: "{{deploy-factory.address}}"
    contract: "{{Contract(MyContract)}}"  # Reference to the contract to verify
    constructorArguments: "0x000000000000000000000000..."  # Optional hex-encoded args
    platform: "etherscan_v2"  # Optional, defaults to "all" (tries all configured platforms)
```

## Skip Conditions

Avoid redundant operations with skip conditions:

### `contract-exists`
Skip if contract exists at address:

```yaml
skip_condition:
  - type: "contract-exists"
    arguments:
      address: "{{computed_address}}"
```

### `job-completed`
Skip if another job is completed:

```yaml
skip_condition:
  - type: "job-completed"
    arguments:
      job: "prerequisite-job"
```

## Standard Templates

Catapult includes several standard templates:

- **`sequence-universal-deployer-2`**: Deploy contracts using Sequence's Universal Deployer v2
- **`nano-universal-deployer`**: Deploy contracts using the Nano Universal Deployer
- **`erc-2470`** and raw variant: CREATE2 Deployer (singleton factory)
- **`assured-deployment`**: Helper to ensure a contract is deployed at a specific address
- **`min-balance`**: Ensure minimum balance for any given address
- Raw building blocks: `raw-sequence-universal-deployer-2`, `raw-nano-universal-deployer`, `raw-erc-2470`

## Contract Resolution

Catapult automatically discovers and indexes contract artifacts in your project. It supports:

- **JSON artifacts** (Hardhat, Truffle, Foundry)
- **Nested directory structures**
- **Hash-based contract references**
- **Path-based contract references**
- **Name-based contract references**

Reference contracts in your YAML using the new unified Contract() syntax:

```yaml
creationCode: "{{Contract(path/to/MyContract).creationCode}}"
# or
creationCode: "{{Contract(0x1234...hash).creationCode}}"
```

## Output Format

After successful deployment, Catapult generates JSON files in the `output/` directory for each job. The output format is optimized to reduce repetition:

### Success Grouping

Networks with identical deployment outputs are grouped together:

```json
{
  "jobName": "core-contracts",
  "jobVersion": "1.0.0",
  "lastRun": "2025-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "networks": [
    {
      "status": "success",
      "chainIds": ["1", "42161", "137"],
      "outputs": {
        "deploy-factory.address": "0x742d35Cc6ab8b3c7B3d4B8b3aB4c8f9e9C8e8aB6",
        "deploy-factory.txHash": "0xabc123...",
        "deploy-implementation.address": "0x123abc..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Handling

When deployments fail on specific networks, each failure is recorded separately:

```json
{
  "jobName": "core-contracts", 
  "jobVersion": "1.0.0",
  "lastRun": "2025-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "networks": [
    {
      "status": "success",
      "chainIds": ["1", "42161"],
      "outputs": {
        "deploy-factory.address": "0x742d35Cc6ab8b3c7B3d4B8b3aB4c8f9e9C8e8aB6"
      }
    },
    {
      "status": "error",
      "chainId": "137",
      "error": "Transaction failed: insufficient funds"
    }
  ]
}
```

This format ensures:
- **Minimal repetition**: Successful deployments with identical outputs across multiple networks are grouped together
- **Clear error tracking**: Individual network failures are clearly documented
- **Scalability**: The format remains readable even with deployments across dozens of networks

Output layout and selection:

- By default, output files mirror the structure under `jobs/` (e.g., `jobs/core/job.yaml` -> `output/core/job.json`). Use `--flat-output` to write all job JSON files directly under `output/`.
- You can control which action outputs are persisted per job using the `output` flag on actions:
  - `output: true` to include all outputs for that action
  - `output: false` to exclude outputs for that action
  - `output: { key1: true, key2: true }` to include only specific keys from that action (e.g., `txHash`, `address`)

## Environment Variables

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Signer private key (alternative to `--private-key`)
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: API key for Etherscan v2 verification (alternative to `--etherscan-api-key`)

You can load environment variables from a file using `--dotenv <path>` on the `run` command (defaults to `.env` in the current directory when provided).
